___
1. ***How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)***  
  - 11

2. ***Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:***
  - Unit Test Demo Work: 10 Hrs
  - Team Discussions on Unit Testing: 1 Hr

3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - I have developed the majority of the frontend app, excluding some more complex
  features such as a login system
  - The core components work and most of the backend endpoints can be called from the app
  - Unit tests are present for most components, but not all.

4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - My progress is ok. Developing the frontend app was straightforward but testing
  it has been painful. I am using lots of Material UI components which make the app
  look great but are difficult to write unit tests for and are better suited for 
  automation tests. I likely won't be able to test everything through unit testing.

5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - Begin the frontend login work
  - Integrate the frontend with more backend endpoints
  - Start working on the physical enclosure for the cocktail system

6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - One of our ultrasonic rangefinders appears to be dead while the other three worked perfectly
  out of the box. We will present our demo with only three sensors and see if the university can
  maybe loan us another one.
